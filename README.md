# MAM_loss

TensorFlow implementation of 'Multiplicative Angular Margin Loss for Text-Based Person Search' accepted by ACM MM ASIA2021

We implement our proposed method by rewriting the train_models.py and modules.py file in  **[Deep Cross-Modal Pojection Learning for Image-Text Matching](https://github.com/YingZhangDUT/Cross-Modal-Projection-Learning)**

To reproduce our proposed method, you should first replace the original train_models.py file with our modified one and then follow the instructions in the repository
